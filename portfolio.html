      <p class="animated fadeInUp">Localvore is a mobile application designed to boost local food and store sales throughout a specific region based on the users location. When solving the problem of finding fresh local food, I discovered there was not an app that showcases users trusted stores to source their local goods at while promoting local businesses. This app connects users to these local stores with a touch of a button.<br></br>

      Users can sign up through social media by linking their Facebook, Instagram or Twitter accounts and or sign-up feature. The cost of the mobile application is free due to the paid advertisements local store owners can put on the app. The application is consisted of a mix of store owners and local buyer who consume these products (hence the name 'Localvore') that post images of their products or purchased items. The long scrolling page was emulated from Instagram giving users a long list of images that they could view.<br></br>

      Each store can sign up for free to promote their business on the application and have the option of placing their products at the top of the page for a cost. When conducting a survey at Smorgasboard in Brooklyn, I found out that 8 out of 10 users would find this application useful on a daily basis. Whether it was figuring out what to have for lunch, sourcing fresh local produce or finding vintage furniture for their brand new studio apartment, Localvore would be an option for users to find that special product.</p>

      <p class="animated fadeInUp">This project was a collaboration between EGC Group and Ten Pin Brewing Co. in Washington State with multiple people involved. Ten Pin Brewing Co. was launched in 2013 and is looking to launch their beer in 2016. When starting this project, we knew we wanted incorporate the bowling theme in their brand without screaming bowling ally. We came up with the logo that is representational of a bowling lane with the hint of wood characteristics and markings. Here is the finished logo, growler bottles and building sign we came up with.</p>

      <h2 class="animated fadeInUp">VAST</h2>
      <p class="animated fadeInUp">I have a very close connection to the outdoors. I can place a finger on almost every state down the East Coast of the United States (and Alaska for the West Coast) and tell you where I have been and what I did. My friends and family are all about the outdoors and I thought that I should connect them a little closer before they actually stepped foot on their journey. I created a outdoor clothing company that connects users a to brand where it can take them everywhere they ever imagined at an affordable cost. The mobile application connects users to areas that they want to discover and what products they should take with them based on experts. The application also gives users reviews, pictures and tips from experts. The products vary from carabiners, shoes, pants to canoes. </p>

      <p class="animated fadeInUp">This project started when I was lighting a Glade Candle one evening and I noticed that the scent was covering the room. I orginally started with a candle on a table showing the effects of the candle, but I wanted to push my design and make it more conceptual. I decided to cover the whole page with the specific color of the scent...just like it covered my whole room. </p>
