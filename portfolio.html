      <h2 class="animated fadeInUp">Localvore – Mobile Application</h2>
      <p class="animated fadeInUp">Localvore is a mobile application designed to boost local food and store sales throughout a specific region based on the users location. When solving the problem of finding fresh local food, I discovered there was not an app that showcases users trusted stores to source their local goods, all while promoting the local businesses. This app connects users to these local stores with a touch of a button.<br>

Users can sign up through social media by linking their Facebook, Instagram or Twitter accounts and or through a one time sign-up feature. The cost of the mobile application is free due to the paid advertisements local store owners can put on the app. The application is consisted of a mix of store owners and local buyer who consume these products (hence the name 'Localvore') that post images of their products or purchased items. The long scrolling page was emulated from Instagram giving users a long list of images that they could view. All pages are based on the users location, giving them specific stores they can source their desired products.<br>

Each store can sign up for free to promote their business on the application and have the option of placing their products at the top of the page for a cost. When conducting a survey at Smorgasboard in Brooklyn, I found out that 8 out of 10 users would find this application useful on a daily basis. Whether it was figuring out what to have for lunch, sourcing fresh local produce or finding vintage furniture for their brand new studio apartment, Localvore would be an option for users to find that special product.<br>

      <p class="animated fadeInUp">This project was a collaboration between Hodes and TIAA-CREF with multiple people involved. TIAA issued new branding and I was in charge of designer their new career website. After figuring out the pages with the team, I followed the new style guides and created the website. Carefully creating drivers and sections, I made sure to push the color palate of colors when designing. Their original website was bland and they mentioned they wanted it to be more "colorful". Take a look yourself! <a href="http://careers.tiaa.org/" target="_blank">Website Link</a> </p>

      <h2 class="animated fadeInUp">TenPin Brewing</h2>
      <p class="animated fadeInUp">This project was a collaboration between EGC Group and Ten Pin Brewing Co. in Washington State with multiple people involved. Ten Pin Brewing Co. was launched in 2013 and fully launched their full line of products in 2016. When starting this project, we knew we wanted incorporate the bowling theme in their brand without screaming it. Their brewery is next to Lake Bowl, which was opened in 1967 and had a reputation for serving the coldest beer on tap in the area.  We came up with the logo that is representational of a bowling lane with the hint of wood characteristics and markings. The components of this project that I focused on were the research of branding and logo completion.

      <p class="animated fadeInUp">This project was a collaboration between Hodes and Brinker International with multiple people involved. Brinker consists of Chili's & Maggiano's and in the last couple months, my team created the new Chili's Career Website. They we so pleased with our work, they wanted us to make the corporate site. They wanted everything to POP and for us to condense what they originally had on their previous website. After completing the website, we added additional images provided by Brinker that they created. <a href="http://www.brinkerjobs.com/" target="_blank">Website Link</a> </p>

      <p class="animated fadeInUp">I have a very close connection to the outdoors. I can place a finger on almost every state down the East Coast of the United States (and Alaska for the West Coast) and tell you where I have been and what I did. My friends and family are all about the outdoors and I thought that I should help them out before they stepped foot on their journey. I created an outdoor gear company that connects users to brands and products that they will need for their trip. The mobile application connects users to areas that they want to discover and what products they should take with them based on experts. The application also gives users reviews, pictures and tips from experts. The products vary from carabiners, shoes, pants to canoes. The main goal of this project was to reduce the number of websites/applications that users use to figure out gear to bring with them on trips.

I orginally started with a candle on a table showing the effects of the candle, but I wanted to push my design and make it more conceptual.
